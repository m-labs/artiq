Installing ARTIQ
================

The preferred way of installing ARTIQ is through the use of the conda package manager.
The conda package contains pre-built binaries that you can directly flash to your board.
But you can also :ref:`install from sources <install-from-sources>`.

.. warning::
    NIST users need to pay close attention to their ``umask``. The sledgehammer
    called ``secureconfig`` leaves you (and root) with umask 027 and files
    created by root (e.g. ``sudo make install``) inaccessible to you.
    The usual umask is 022.

Installing using conda
----------------------

Installing Anaconda or Miniconda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* You can either install Anaconda (choose Python 3.5) from https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/

* Or install the more minimalistic Miniconda (choose Python 3.5) from http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html

.. warning::
    If you are installing on Windows, choose the Windows 32-bit version regardless of whether you have
    a 32-bit or 64-bit Windows.

After installing either Anaconda or Miniconda, open a new terminal and make sure the following command works::

    $ conda

If it prints the help of the ``conda`` command, your install is OK.
If not, then make sure your ``$PATH`` environment variable contains the path to anaconda3/bin (or miniconda3/bin)::

    $ echo $PATH
    /home/.../miniconda3/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin

If your ``$PATH`` misses reference the miniconda3/bin or anaconda3/bin you can fix this by typing::

    $ export PATH=$HOME/miniconda3:$PATH

Installing the host side software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For this, you need to add our Anaconda repository to your conda configuration::

    $ conda config --add channels http://conda.anaconda.org/m-labs/channel/main
    $ conda config --add channels http://conda.anaconda.org/m-labs/channel/dev

Then you can install the ARTIQ package, it will pull all the necessary dependencies.

* For the Pipistrello board::

    $ ENV=$(date +artiq-%Y-%m-%d); conda create -n $ENV artiq-pipistrello-nist_qc1; \
        echo "Created environment $ENV for ARTIQ"

* For the KC705 board with SCSI cables and AD9858 DDS chips::

    $ ENV=$(date +artiq-%Y-%m-%d); conda create -n $ENV artiq-kc705-nist_qc1; \
        echo "Created environment $ENV for ARTIQ"

* For the KC705 board with the FMC backplane and AD9914 DDS chips::

    $ ENV=$(date +artiq-%Y-%m-%d); conda create -n $ENV artiq-kc705-nist_qc2; \
        echo "Created environment $ENV for ARTIQ"

This creates a new Conda "environment" (i.e. an isolated installation) and prints its name.
If you ever need to upgrade ARTIQ, it is advised to install it again
in a new environment so that you can roll back to a version that is known to
work correctly.

After this, add the newly created environment to your ``$PATH``. This can be easily
done using the following command::

    $ source activate artiq-[date]

You will need to invoke this command in every new shell. When in doubt, you can list
the existing environments using::

    $ conda env list

Preparing the core device FPGA board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You now need to flash 3 things on the FPGA board:

1. The FPGA bitstream
2. The BIOS
3. The ARTIQ runtime

First you need to :ref:`install openocd <install-openocd>`. Then, you can flash the board:

* For the Pipistrello board::

    $ artiq_flash -t pipistrello

* For the KC705 board::

    $ artiq_flash

Next step (for KC705) is to flash MAC and IP addresses to the board:

* See :ref:`those instructions <flash-mac-ip-addr>` to flash MAC and IP addresses.

.. _install-from-sources:

Installing from source
----------------------

Preparing the build environment for the core device
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These steps are required to generate code that can run on the core
device. They are necessary both for building the MiSoC BIOS
and the ARTIQ kernels.

* Create a development directory: ::

        $ mkdir ~/artiq-dev

* Clone ARTIQ repository: ::

        $ cd ~/artiq-dev
        $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/m-labs/artiq

* Install OpenRISC binutils (or1k-linux-...): ::

        $ cd ~/artiq-dev
        $ wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils/binutils-2.25.1.tar.bz2
        $ tar xvf binutils-2.25.1.tar.bz2
        $ rm binutils-2.25.1.tar.bz2

        $ cd binutils-2.25.1
        $ patch -p1 <~/artiq-dev/misc/binutils-2.25.1-or1k-R_PCREL-pcrel_offset.patch

        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build
        $ ../configure --target=or1k-linux --prefix=/usr/local
        $ make -j4
        $ sudo make install

.. note::
    We're using an ``or1k-linux`` target because it is necessary to enable
    shared library support in ``ld``, not because Linux is involved.

* Install LLVM and Clang: ::

        $ cd ~/artiq-dev
        $ git clone https://github.com/openrisc/llvm-or1k
        $ cd llvm-or1k/tools
        $ git clone https://github.com/openrisc/clang-or1k clang
        $ cd ..

        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build
        $ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/llvm-or1k -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="OR1K;X86" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Rel -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON
        $ make -j4
        $ sudo make install

.. note::
    Compilation of LLVM can take more than 30 min on some machines.

Preparing the core device FPGA board
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These steps are required to generate bitstream (``.bit``) files, build the MiSoC BIOS and ARTIQ runtime, and flash FPGA boards. If the board is already flashed, you may skip those steps and go directly to `Installing the host-side software`.

* Install the FPGA vendor tools (e.g. Xilinx ISE and/or Vivado):

    * Get Xilinx tools from http://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.htm. ISE can build bitstreams both for boards using the Spartan-6 (Pipistrello) and 7-series devices (KC705), while Vivado supports only boards using 7-series devices.

    * The Pipistrello is supported by Webpack, the KC705 is not.

    * During the Xilinx toolchain installation, uncheck ``Install cable drivers`` (they are not required as we use better and open source alternatives).

* Install Migen: ::

        $ cd ~/artiq-dev
        $ git clone https://github.com/m-labs/migen
        $ cd migen
        $ python3.5 setup.py develop --user

.. note::
    The options ``develop`` and ``--user`` are for setup.py to install Migen in ``~/.local/lib/python3.5``.

.. _install-openocd:

* Install JTAG tools needed to program the Pipistrello and KC705:

    ::

        $ cd ~/artiq-dev
        $ git clone https://github.com/ntfreak/openocd.git
        $ cd openocd
        $ sudo apt-get install build-essentials libtool libusb-1.0-0-dev libftdi-dev
        $ ./bootstrap
        $ ./configure
        $ make
        $ sudo make install
        $ sudo cp contrib/99-openocd.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
        $ adduser $USER plugdev

.. _install-flash-proxy:

* Install the required flash proxy bitstreams:

    The purpose of the flash proxy bitstream is to give programming software fast JTAG access to the flash connected to the FPGA.

    * Pipistrello and KC705:

        ::

            $ cd ~/artiq-dev
            $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordens/bscan_spi_bitstreams/master/bscan_spi_xc7k325t.bit
            $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordens/bscan_spi_bitstreams/master/bscan_spi_xc6slx45.bit

        Then move both files ``~/artiq-dev/bscan_spi_xc6slx45.bit`` and ``~/artiq-dev/bscan_spi_xc7k325t.bit`` to ``~/.migen``, ``/usr/local/share/migen``, or ``/usr/share/migen``.


* Download and install MiSoC: ::

        $ cd ~/artiq-dev
        $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/m-labs/misoc
        $ cd misoc
        $ python3.5 setup.py develop --user

* Download and install ARTIQ: ::

        $ cd ~/artiq-dev
        $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/m-labs/artiq
        $ cd artiq
        $ python3.5 setup.py develop --user

.. note::
    If you have any trouble during ARTIQ setup about ``pygit2`` installation,
    refer to the section dealing with
    :ref:`installing the host-side software <installing-the-host-side-software>`.


* Build the bitstream, BIOS and runtime by running:
    ::

        $ cd ~/artiq-dev
        $ export PATH=/usr/local/llvm-or1k/bin:$PATH

    .. note:: Make sure that ``/usr/local/llvm-or1k/bin`` is first in your ``PATH``, so that the ``clang`` command you just built is found instead of the system one, if any.

    * For Pipistrello::

        $ python3.5 -m artiq.gateware.targets.pipistrello

    * For KC705::

        $ python3.5 -m artiq.gateware.targets.kc705 -H qc1  # or qc2

* Then, gather the binaries and flash them: ::

        $ mkdir binaries
        $ cp misoc_nist_qcX_<board>/gateware/top.bit binaries
        $ cp misoc_nist_qcX_<board>/software/bios/bios.bin binaries
        $ cp misoc_nist_qcX_<board>/software/runtime/runtime.fbi binaries
        $ cd binaries
        $ artiq_flash -d . -t <board>

.. note:: The `-t` option specifies the board your are targeting. Available options are ``kc705`` and ``pipistrello``.

* Check that the board boots by running a serial terminal program (you may need to press its FPGA reconfiguration button or power-cycle it to load the bitstream that was newly written into the flash): ::

        $ make -C ~/artiq-dev/misoc/tools # do only once
        $ ~/artiq-dev/misoc/tools/flterm --port /dev/ttyUSB1
        MiSoC BIOS   http://m-labs.hk
        [...]
        Booting from flash...
        Loading xxxxx bytes from flash...
        Executing booted program.
        ARTIQ runtime built <date/time>

The communication parameters are 115200 8-N-1. Ensure that your user has access
to the serial device (``sudo adduser $USER dialout`` assuming standard setup).

.. _installing-the-host-side-software:

Installing the host-side software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Install the llvmlite Python bindings: ::

        $ cd ~/artiq-dev
        $ git clone https://github.com/m-labs/llvmlite
        $ cd llvmlite
        $ git checkout artiq
        $ LLVM_CONFIG=/usr/local/llvm-or1k/bin/llvm-config python3.5 setup.py install --user

* Install ARTIQ: ::

        $ cd ~/artiq-dev
        $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/m-labs/artiq # if not already done
        $ cd artiq
        $ python3.5 setup.py develop --user

.. note::
    If you have any trouble during ARTIQ setup about ``pygit2`` installation,
    you can install it by using ``pip``:

    On Ubuntu 14.04::

        $ python3.5 `which pip3` install --user pygit2==0.19.1

    On Ubuntu 14.10::

        $ python3.5 `which pip3` install --user pygit2==0.20.3

    On Ubuntu 15.04 and 15.10::

        $ python3.5 `which pip3` install --user pygit2==0.22.1

    The rationale behind this is that pygit2 and libgit2 must have the same
    major.minor version numbers.

    See http://www.pygit2.org/install.html#version-numbers

* Build the documentation: ::

        $ cd ~/artiq-dev/artiq/doc/manual
        $ make html

Configuring the core device
---------------------------

This should be done after either installation method (conda or source).

.. _flash-mac-ip-addr:

* Set the MAC and IP address in the :ref:`core device configuration flash storage <core-device-flash-storage>`:

    * You can either set it by generating a flash storage image and then flash it: ::

        $ artiq_mkfs flash_storage.img -s mac xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx -s ip xx.xx.xx.xx
        $ artiq_flash -f flash_storage.img proxy storage start

    * Or you can set it via the runtime test mode command line

        * Boot the board.

        * Quickly run flterm (in ``path/to/misoc/tools``) to access the serial console.

        * If you weren't quick enough to see anything in the serial console, press the reset button.

        * Wait for "Press 't' to enter test mode..." to appear and hit the ``t`` key.

        * Enter the following commands (which will erase the flash storage content).

            ::

                test> fserase
                test> fswrite ip xx.xx.xx.xx
                test> fswrite mac xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

        * Then reboot.

        You should see something like this in the serial console: ::

            $ ./tools/flterm --port /dev/ttyUSB1
            [FLTERM] Starting...

            MiSoC BIOS   http://m-labs.hk
            (c) Copyright 2007-2014 Sebastien Bourdeauducq
            [...]
            Press 't' to enter test mode...
            Entering test mode.
            test> fserase
            test> fswrite ip 192.168.10.2
            test> fswrite mac 11:22:33:44:55:66

.. note:: The reset button of the KC705 board is the "CPU_RST" labeled button.
.. warning:: Both those instructions will result in the flash storage being wiped out. However you can use the test mode to change the IP/MAC without erasing everything if you skip the "fserase" command.

* (optional) Flash the idle kernel

The idle kernel is the kernel (some piece of code running on the core device) which the core device runs whenever it is not connected to a PC via ethernet.
This kernel is therefore stored in the :ref:`core device configuration flash storage <core-device-flash-storage>`.
To flash the idle kernel:

        * Compile the idle experiment:
                The idle experiment's ``run()`` method must be a kernel: it must be decorated with the ``@kernel`` decorator (see :ref:`next topic <connecting-to-the-core-device>` for more information about kernels).

                Since the core device is not connected to the PC, RPCs (calling Python code running on the PC from the kernel) are forbidden in the idle experiment.
                ::

                $ artiq_compile idle.py

        * Write it into the core device configuration flash storage: ::

                $ artiq_coreconfig write -f idle_kernel idle.elf

.. note:: You can find more information about how to use the ``artiq_coreconfig`` utility on the :ref:`Utilities <core-device-configuration-tool>` page.

* (optional) Flash the startup kernel

The startup kernel is executed once when the core device powers up. It should initialize DDSes, set up TTL directions, etc. Proceed as with the idle kernel, but using the ``startup_kernel`` key in ``artiq_coreconfig``.

* (optional) Select the startup clock

The core device may use either an external clock signal or its internal clock. This clock can be switched dynamically after the PC is connected using the ``external_clock`` parameter of the core device driver; however, one may want to select the clock at power-up so that it is used for the startup and idle kernels. Use one of these commands: ::

    $ artiq_coreconfig write -s startup_clock i  # internal clock (default)
    $ artiq_coreconfig write -s startup_clock e  # external clock
