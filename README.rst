ARTIQ (Advanced Real-Time Infrastructure for Quantum physics) is a
next-generation control system for quantum information experiments. It is
developed in partnership with the Ion Storage Group at NIST, and its
applicability reaches beyond ion trapping.

The system features a high-level programming language that helps describing
complex experiments, which is compiled and executed on dedicated hardware with
nanosecond timing resolution and sub-microsecond latency.

Technologies employed include Python, Migen, MiSoC/mor1kx, LLVM and llvmlite.
