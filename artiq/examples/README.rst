ARTIQ experiment examples
=========================

This directory contains several sample ARTIQ master configurations
and associated experiments that illustrate basic usage of various
hardware and software features.

New users might want to peruse the ``no_hardware`` directory to
explore the argument/dataset machinery without needing access to
hardware, and the ``kc705_nist_clock`` directory for inspiration
on how to coordinate between host and FPGA core device code.
