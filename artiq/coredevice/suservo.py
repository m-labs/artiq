    """Sampler-Urukul Servo parent and configuration device.

    Sampler-Urukul Servo is a integrated device controlling one
    8-channel ADC (Sampler) and two 4-channel DDS (Urukuls) with a DSP engine
    connecting the ADC data and the DDS output amplitudes to enable
    feedback. SU Servo can for example be used to implement intensity
    stabilization of laser beams with an amplifier and AOM driven by Urukul
    and a photodetector connected to Sampler.

    Additionally SU Servo supports multiple preconfigured profiles per channel
    and features like automatic integrator hold.

    Notes:

        * See the SU Servo variant of the Kasli target for an example of how to
          connect the gateware and the devices. Sampler and each Urukul need
          two EEM connections.
        * Ensure that both Urukuls are AD9910 variants and have the on-board
          dip switches set to 1100 (first two on, last two off).
        * Refer to the Sampler and Urukul documentation and the SU Servo
          example device database for runtime configuration of the devices
          (PLLs, gains, clock routing etc.)
