    **Transfer Sequence**:

    * If desired, write the ``config`` register (:meth:`set_config`)
      to configure and activate the core.
    * If desired, write the ``xfer`` register (:meth:`set_xfer`)
      to set ``cs_n``, ``write_length``, and ``read_length``.
    * :meth:`write` to the ``data`` register (also for transfers with
      zero bits to be written). Writing starts the transfer.
    * If desired, :meth:`read_sync` (or :meth:`read_async` followed by a
      :meth:`input_async` later) the ``data`` register corresponding to
      the last completed transfer.
    * If desired, :meth:`set_xfer` for the next transfer.
    * If desired, :meth:`write` ``data`` queuing the next
      (possibly chained) transfer.

    **Notes**:

    * In order to chain a transfer onto an in-flight transfer without
      deasserting ``cs`` in between, the second :meth:`write` needs to
      happen strictly later than ``2*ref_period_mu`` (two coarse RTIO
      cycles) but strictly earlier than ``xfer_period_mu + write_period_mu``
      after the first. Note that :meth:`write` already applies a delay of
      ``xfer_period_mu + write_period_mu``.
    * A full transfer takes ``write_period_mu + xfer_period_mu``.
    * Chained transfers can happen every ``xfer_period_mu``.
    * Read data is available every ``xfer_period_mu`` starting
      a bit after xfer_period_mu (depending on ``clk_phase``).
    * As a consequence, in order to chain transfers together, new data must
      be written before the pending transfer's read data becomes available.
