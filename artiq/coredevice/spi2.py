          Framing and chip selection can also be handled independently

          ``mosi`` signal at any point.

          somewhere downstream. If it is decoded, "``cs`` all deasserted"
          should be handled accordingly (no slave selected).
          If it is one-hot, asserting multiple slaves should only be attempted

          collector, or correctly multiplexed externally.
