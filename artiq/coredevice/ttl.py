    In output mode, provides functions to set the logic level on the signal.

    In input mode, provides functions to analyze the incoming signal, with
    real-time gating to prevent overflows.

    RTIO TTLs supports zero-length transition suppression. For example, if
    two pulses are emitted back-to-back with no delay between them, they will
    be merged into a single pulse with a duration equal to the sum of the
    durations of the original pulses.

    This should be used with bidirectional channels.

    Note that the channel is in input mode by default. If you need to drive a
    signal, you must call :meth:`output`. If the channel is in output mode most of
    the time in your setup, it is a good idea to call :meth:`output` in the
    startup kernel.

    There are three input APIs: gating, sampling and watching. When one
    API is active (e.g. the gate is open, or the input events have not been
    fully read out), another API must not be used simultaneously.
